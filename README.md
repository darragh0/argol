**argol** is a simple but powerful **domain-specific language (DSL)** designed for defining and organizing command-line argument structures. With a `.argol` file, you declare the arguments, options, flags, and subcommands for your application's CLI in a clean and standardized format, ensuring consistent behaviour, validation, and parsing.

The **argol language**  separates your CLI argument logic from the core application code, enabling you to manage and modify your argument structure independently. argol is language-agnostic, providing a standard way to define CLI interfaces.
